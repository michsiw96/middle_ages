### Game description
Game is played on square board of size `n * n` (`8 < n < 2^31`)
by two players taking turns making their moves. Every player controls
his pieces from one of three types: king, knight, peasant. 
At the beginning of the game player has 1 king, 1 peasant and 2 knights,
which are placed next to each other in horizontal line in order 
king, peasant, knight, knight. Placement is determined by randomizing
positions of kings from first `n - 3` columns in a way that
the distance between kings is at least 8 in maximum metric space.

During every turn player can move each of his pieces once.
Every piece can move one square in every direction, in addition a peasant
can produce another peasant or a knight. When two pieces are on the same
square they fight. When two pieces of the same type fight, they both die and
disappear from the board. Otherwise a knight wins with a king or a peasant, and
a king defeats a peasant. A player can not have two pieces on the same square.
A peasant can produce a piece on any of free neighbouring squares
if and only if he did not take any action in the last two turns.
So for example if a peasant moved in turn `k' he can produce a piece
in turn `k + 3`.

Game ends when one of kings dies or after `k-th` turn of a second player.
The player having only alive king wins, otherwise it is a draw.
